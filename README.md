# HADOOP CLASS NOTES
------
#### NEED
Reasons for Hadoop:
A.Scalability:
    1. Disadvantages of Scale Up (Vertical)
        i. Vertical scaling isnt infinite (Scale up)
        ii. Is costly(High Performance Computing)
        iii. Has low fault tolerance 
    2. More data, variety of data, to be processed in limited time-frames
    3. Volume/Velocity/Veracity
    Hadoop is horizontal scaling
B. Dampeners for distributed computing:
    1. Distribution of data
    2. Sending queries to data store
    3. Managing the cluster in case of failure
    These have been resolved by Hadoop
